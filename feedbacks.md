Page 4: Feedback on Find Projects & Latest Updates
Find Projects Page:

The User Interface (UI) is bad on desktop and mobile. Text fonts and arrangements need improvement.

The User Experience (UX) is bad. The Local Government (LG) and Wards dropdown lists do not correspond correctly (selecting an LGA doesn't filter the wards).

The "Search" button is not working.

Latest Updates Section:
4. The UX is bad on desktop and mobile.
5. On Desktop: Show a maximum of 3 project cards, sliding every 5 seconds.
6. On Mobile: Show a maximum of 1 project card, sliding every 5 seconds.
7. This section should display the last 20 projects.
8. The UI for "Latest Updates" and the fonts need to be improved.
9. The status of a project should be displayed (e.g., "Proposed", "Ongoing", "Completed"), not "approved".
10. The category of the project should be displayed clearly.

Page 5: Feedback on Footer / Subscription
(This page contains fragmented and unclear feedback, but the actionable points are:)

The "Subscribe Update" section and "Quick Links" need content review and correction (the text appears to be placeholder or incorrect).

The "Project Categories" and "Contact Info" sections contain nonsensical or placeholder text and need to be completely redone with accurate information.

Page 6: Feedback on Real-time Updates & Community Section
UI/UX is good on desktop but bad on mobile.

On mobile, the content in this section should be in a slider that changes every 5 seconds.

Revamp the UI and font for the text in this section.

The term "Polling Units" should be replaced with "Zones", and the selectable list should be "A, B, C".

The "Local Government Area" and "Ward" filter lists are not corresponding appropriately.

Remove the "Submitted to Business Reports" and "User Information" sections entirely. The reason given is that they are not working, and the data is not visible in the super admin dashboard.

Page 7: Feedback on “View All Projects” or “Projects” Page
UI/UX is good on desktop but very bad on mobile.

The "Filters" section should contain filters for "Year" and "Month".

On Mobile: Filter parameters (LGA, Ward, Category, Status, Year, Month) should be expandable (+) and collapsible (-) under the "Filters" heading.

Pagination: Both on desktop and mobile, pagination should be implemented, with each page showing a maximum of 10 project cards.

The status "Pending" should be replaced with the standard project status: "Proposed", "Ongoing", or "Completed".

The dollar sign ($) should be removed from the budget display.

The "Start" and "Expected" dates should be removed from this listing page.

Projects that have images are not displaying them.

Revamp the text font style and arrangement on the project cards.

Page 8: Feedback on User Profile
The profile page is missing (404 error - page not found).

Page 9: Feedback on Report Project Feature
Report Form:

On desktop, the text arrangement is not nice. Bad UI, needs a revamp.

The "Reasons for reporting" list should be edited to:

Quality Concerns

Timeline discrepancies

Budget concerns

Inaccurate information

Fraudulent project

Project incompleteness

Others

The placeholder text in the form should have a smaller font size and a fainter color.

The "Cancel" button is not functioning.

The report is not submitting, even for a signed-in user.

Page 10: Feedback on Project Detail Page
Everything a publisher fills in the "Submit Project" form must be displayed on this page.

The "Submit Project" form is missing the following fields that need to be added and displayed:

Completion Date

Date of Receiving Funds

Project Impact (A description of how the project impacts community members)

Community Statement (The official gratitude message from the community leader)

Name of the community leader

Phone number of the community leader

Address of the community leader (to appear as a signature)

The UI/UX for the project detail page needs improvement.

Comments should be paginated, showing 10 comments per page
